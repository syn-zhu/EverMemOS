I was full of anticipation to climb the Great Wall, but when I got there it was absolutely packed with people. Forget about enjoying the scenery - I was basically pushed along by the crowd. It was hard to even stop and catch my breath, and I couldn't take a single decent photo - just heads everywhere. What drove me crazy the most was that I didn't book Forbidden City tickets in advance, so when I arrived at the gate I was told tickets had long sold out. I could only stand there staring, watching others go in, feeling really regretful. And Shichahai was way too commercialized - vendors hawking everywhere, nothing like the peaceful old Beijing atmosphere I had imagined. After this trip, not only is my body exhausted, but my heart is even more tired. It completely failed to achieve the purpose of relaxation.",

The Great Wall during peak season is indeed a challenge for any \"hero\" - being swept along by the crowd completely ruins the mood for sightseeing. As for Forbidden City tickets, they're truly hard to get nowadays. Many tourists who don't plan ahead fall into this trap - that feeling of being so close yet unable to enter is really frustrating. The commercialization of Shichahai is also something many seasoned travelers complain about. Although this trip left many regrets, it's still a memorable experience (albeit not a pleasant one).

Aerobic Exercise: At least 150 minutes of moderate intensity weekly. Beginner (first 2 weeks): Brisk walking/light yoga/stretching, 30-40 minutes. Progression (weeks 3-6): Brisk walking + slow jogging/swimming/cycling, 40-60 minutes. Maintenance: Slow jogging + interval training, 5 times/week. Intensity gauge: Can talk but can't sing. Strength Training: 2-3 times/week, bodyweight squats 10-15 reps × 3 sets, push-ups 10 reps × 3 sets, plank 20-30 seconds × 3 sets. Post-meal Activity: Walk for 10-15 minutes 20-30 minutes after each meal. Daily Schedule: Morning brisk walk/stretching 10-15 minutes, afternoon light walk 10 minutes, evening brisk walk/slow jog 40-60 minutes, strength training 2 days/week. Safety: Warm up and stretch before and after exercise, wait at least 30 minutes after meals before exercising, avoid high-impact activities, ensure sleep ≥7 hours.

If diagnosed as Grade I-II sprain, the following plan applies. Phase 1: Acute Phase (0-3 days) - POLICE Principle: Protection (avoid weight-bearing, use crutches/ankle brace), Optimal Loading (move toes within pain-free range, 10 towel curls per hour), Ice (15 minutes every 2-3 hours), Compression (elastic bandage/ankle brace), Elevation (foot above heart level). Avoid: Heat, massage, alcohol, vigorous activity. Phase 2: Recovery Phase (4 days-2 weeks): Ankle pumps 20 reps × 4-6 sets/day, alphabet writing (A-Z) 2 times/day, resistance band exercises (inversion/eversion/dorsiflexion/plantarflexion) 10 reps × 3 sets, single-leg stance (healthy side) 30 seconds × 3 sets. Criteria to stop using crutches: Pain-free walking, no obvious swelling, stable ankle. Phase 3: Functional Reconstruction (after 2 weeks): Balance training (single-leg stance eyes open to closed), agility training (T-shaped shuttle runs), jump training (double to single leg). Criteria before returning to badminton: 20 pain-free single-leg calf raises, 10 single-leg jumps without discomfort, running and changing directions without ankle giving way. Protection: Wear ankle brace for at least 1-2 months, thorough warm-ups, proper shoes, avoid exercising when fatigued. Recovery time: Grade I 1-2 weeks, Grade II 3-6 weeks, Grade III 6-12 weeks.

Rehabilitation core: Restore stability/proprioception/strength, prevent re-sprains, total timeline 4-6 weeks for light activities, 8-10 weeks to return to badminton. Week 1 (Acute Phase): Days 1-3 use crutches no weight-bearing, days 4-7 partial weight-bearing (pain ≤2/10), ice every 2-3 hours for 15 minutes, compression (elastic bandage/rigid ankle brace), elevation, ankle pumps 20 reps × 6 sets/day, towel curls 10 reps × 4 sets/day. Weeks 2-3 (Recovery Phase): Week 2 full weight-bearing, week 3 slow walk 10-15 minutes, continue using ankle brace, alphabet writing 2 times/day, resistance band exercises (focus on eversion) 15 reps × 3 sets, calf stretches 30 seconds × 3 sets, single-leg stance (healthy side) 30 seconds × 3 sets. Weeks 4-6 (Functional Rebuilding): Single-leg stance (injured side) eyes open to closed 30 seconds × 3 sets, heel raises double to single leg 15 reps × 3 sets, mini squats 10 reps × 3 sets, lateral band walks 10 steps × 3 sets. Week 6 assessment: Single-leg heel raise ≥15 reps pain-free, single-leg stance eyes closed ≥20 seconds, jogging without discomfort. Weeks 7-10 (Return to Sport): Movement tests (straight jog/lateral shuffles/figure-8 run/sudden stops) all pain-free and stable, multi-directional small jumps 2 sets × 10 reps, simulated footwork, wear ankle brace for half-court starting 15 minutes. Protection: Wear ankle brace for at least 3 months when playing, thorough warm-ups, proper shoes, avoid exercising when fatigued. Support: Medications as prescribed, physical therapy can accelerate healing, nutrition increase protein/vitamin C/zinc. Key: Don't skip balance training just because pain is gone - 80% of re-sprains occur because proprioception hasn't fully recovered.",

Continue diet control: Maintain previous healthy eating habits, slightly reduce staple food portions (due to reduced activity). 2. Upper body training: You can do seated dumbbell exercises, resistance band upper body training, 15-20 minutes daily. 3. Core training: Crunches, planks, dead bugs and other movements that don't involve the ankle. 4. Resume exercise in two weeks: Start with brisk walking, 20-30 minutes each time, gradually increasing intensity. Temporarily avoid sudden stop and direction change sports (like badminton), suggest swimming or cycling first. A 1-2kg weight rebound is normal fluctuation, you'll lose it quickly once you resume exercise.",

Ankle pump exercises: Do toe pointing up and down movements while sitting, using muscle contractions to promote blood return. 3.

Correct footwork: Learn proper badminton push-off and landing posture, avoid inversion landing. 5. Fatigue management: Rest when tired, 80% of sports injuries occur in fatigued states. 6.
