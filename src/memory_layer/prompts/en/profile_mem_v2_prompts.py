# Incremental update prompt
PROFILE_V2_UPDATE_PROMPT = '''You are a user profile updater. Based on conversation records, determine what operations to perform on the user profile.

【Current User Profile】(Each item has an index number)
{current_profile}

【Conversation Records】(Multiple conversations from the same topic)
{conversations}

【Task】
Analyze conversations and output a list of operations (can have multiple). Available action types:
- **update**: Modify existing items (specify by index)
- **add**: Add profile items
- **delete**: Delete existing items
- **none**: No operation needed (use when conversation contains no user info)

【Operation Guide】
- **update**: Existing item has updates, supplements, or corrections
- **add**: Discovered completely new user information (unrelated to existing items)
- **delete**: Should delete in these cases:
  - User explicitly negates (e.g., "I'm no longer vegetarian")
  - Info is outdated (e.g., "traveling next week" but it's already passed)
  - Too trivial/useless (e.g., "want pizza today")
  - Directly contradicts new info

【Important Rules】
1. **Tag Mining**: Implicit traits must include [Personality Tags], e.g., [Risk-Averse], [Socially-Driven], [Data-Oriented].
2. Only extract user info, don't treat AI assistant suggestions as user traits
3. sources format: use conversation ID (in brackets, e.g., ep1, ep2)
4. evidence should include time info - e.g., "In Oct 2024 user mentioned..."
5. Index numbers for explicit_info and implicit_traits are independent

【Profile Definitions & Analysis Framework】
- **explicit_info (Explicit Information)**: User facts that can be directly extracted from conversations.
  - *Content*: Basic info, health status, skills, clear preferences.

- **implicit_traits (Implicit Traits)**: Psychological profile, personality tags, and decision styles inferred from behavior.
  - *Extraction Requirement*: Freely analyze from dimensions like decision patterns, social preferences, and life philosophy.
  - *Naming Convention*:
    1. Keep tags short, readable, and reusable for retrieval/comparison (prefer 2–6 words).
    2. Avoid stitching multiple dimensions into one long label; if multiple dimensions exist, split into multiple implicit traits.
    3. Tags should describe stable behavioral/psychological tendencies, not one-off events or short-term states.
  - Make reasonable inferences to extract the user's deep traits

【Output Format】
No operations:
```json
{{"operations": [{{"action": "none"}}], "update_note": "conversation contains no user info"}}
```

With operations (can combine multiple add/update/delete):
```json
{{
  "operations": [
    {{"action": "add", "type": "explicit_info", "data": {{"category": "...", "description": "...", "evidence": "...", "sources": ["ep1"]}}}},
    {{"action": "add", "type": "implicit_traits", "data": {{"trait": "...", "description": "...", "basis": "...", "evidence": "...", "sources": ["ep1", "ep2"]}}}},
    {{"action": "update", "type": "explicit_info", "index": 0, "data": {{"description": "...", "sources": ["ep3"]}}}},
    {{"action": "delete", "type": "implicit_traits", "index": 1, "reason": "..."}}
  ],
  "update_note": "added 2 explicit info and 1 implicit trait, updated 1, deleted 1"
}}
```'''

# Compact prompt
PROFILE_V2_COMPACT_PROMPT = '''The current user profile has {total_items} items (explicit_info + implicit_traits combined), exceeding the limit of {max_items}.

Please compact the profile to **{max_items} items TOTAL** (explicit_info + implicit_traits combined, NOT {max_items} each).

Compaction strategies:
1. **Merge Similar Items**: Combine multiple records of the same dimension into one "Current State + Trend" description.
2. **Refine Tags**: Implicit traits should be summarized as personality tags (e.g., [Risk-Averse]), removing repetitive or shallow descriptions.
3. Delete unimportant, outdated, or short-term statuses.
4. Preserve item fields (especially evidence / sources).

Current Profile:
{profile_text}

**IMPORTANT**: Output must have explicit_info + implicit_traits ≤ {max_items} items TOTAL.
```json
{{
  "explicit_info": [
    {{"category": "...", "description": "...", "evidence": "...", "sources": ["episode_id"]}}
  ],
  "implicit_traits": [
    {{"trait": "...", "description": "...", "basis": "...", "evidence": "...", "sources": ["id1", "id2"]}}
  ],
  "compact_note": "Explain what was deleted/merged"
}}
```'''

# Initial extraction prompt (for batch extraction)
PROFILE_V2_INITIAL_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = '''You are a "User Profile Analyst". Please read the conversation below and build a user profile.

【Part 1: Explicit Information (explicit_info)】
Objective facts and current status.

【Part 2: Implicit Traits (implicit_traits)】
Psychological profile, personality tags, and decision styles inferred from behavior.
*Extraction Requirement*: Freely analyze decision making, social patterns, and values. Trait field must be a highly summarized [Adjective/Noun Phrase Tag].

【Extraction Principles】
1. Only extract information about the user themselves, not assistant suggestions
2. Implicit traits must be supported by multiple evidence: each implicit trait must have at least 2 sources; evidence can come from the current conversations and/or the existing profile's evidence/sources (when updating), not from a single new conversation alone
3. Describe each piece of information in one natural sentence, easy to understand
4. Mark the source (message ID)

【Output Format】
Output JSON directly in the following format:
```json
{{
  "explicit_info": [
    {{
      "category": "category name",
      "description": "one sentence description",
      "evidence": "one-sentence evidence grounded in the conversations",
      "sources": ["YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM|episode_id"]
    }}
  ],
  "implicit_traits": [
    {{
      "trait": "trait name",
      "description": "one sentence description of this trait",
      "basis": "inferred from which behaviors/conversations",
      "evidence": "one-sentence evidence grounded in the conversations",
      "sources": ["YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM|episode_id1", "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM|episode_id2"]
    }}
  ]
}}
```

【Original Conversation】
